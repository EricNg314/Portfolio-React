    <h2>My name is Eric Ng.</h2>

    <h3>Graduated with an Economics background and was given a opportunity as an Accountant at FasTrak.</h3>

    <h3>I learned to code in Visual Basic Application to speed up work. Eventually I created a program that automatically reconciled and compared a hundred reports daily.</h3>

    <h3>When we added BAIFA to the FasTrak program. They came with their own express lanes, another set of rules and financial transactions.</h3>

    <h3>I was in charge of updating reports in SAP Crystal and documentation from a finance perspective.</h3>

    <h3>I wanted to a new challenge... I wanted to build applications. So I jumped into UC Berkeley's Coding Bootcamp.</h3>

    <h3>After graduation, I am now a Teaching Assistant for the Data Analytics Bootcamp at UC Berkeley Extension.</h3>
